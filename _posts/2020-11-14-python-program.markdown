I'm Back!!!

Everyone might wonder where I have been. Frankly speaking, I don't know either! Camel is still stronger than ever, but mostly confined in the Camel house, as we all know what is happening -- COVID :)

Lately, I have been thinking a lot about Passwords. I used to save passwords in a little py file, with all my credentials laying out nicely line by line, next to the account names. Now, before you scold me, I know I know, this is insecure. If the file every gets leaked, I am done. Our talented [Dr. Yu](https://l.etranger.me/) (Remember him from my epic [first post](https://camel.rocks/introduction/2020/06/28/new-start.html)??) also shared the same concern. One day, he saw this little py file and went, 'why don't you encode your passwords?'

I got to say, he always make fair and strong points. So after shamelessly stealing his codes (as always), I am now encrypting my passwords using [Crypto](https://pypi.org/project/pycrypto/). However, this is still inconvenient. If I am on-the-go with my phone and wanted to access some accounts, I don't have this handy script with me to decrypt my passwords. I am also a bit lazy to install mobile python applications to run the script.

So here I am, trying to develop a password en(de)cryptor on my website! Afterall, [camel.rocks](https://camel.rocks/) can't rock without some useful little features right?
