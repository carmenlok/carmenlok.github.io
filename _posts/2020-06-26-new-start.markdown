Hi everyone,









I have never created a website before so this is going to be exciting. For the time being, this website is particularly gibberish, with a preset jekyll theme called [`Prologue`](https://github.com/chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue), which was shamelessly copied from the brilliant [Chris Bobbe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisbobbe1995). Many thanks to him for creating this elegant theme.

Also, courtesy to the ridiculously talented [Dr. Yu](https://l.etranger.me/), who inspired me to set up this website, even though I have no idea what to do with it yet.

In the near future, I am thinking of expanding more on this blog section. I am quite interested in learning German, Japanese, and a bunch of Data Science stuff that I (was forced :D) would like to acquire for my career growth. I might be adding some notes here to help myself learn. If you see me stop posting, feel free to add comments like "B\*tch go learn.", "*HAVE YOU GIVEN UP LEARNING*", "Stop playing switch, update your blog!" here. I would really appreciate that.

Until then, stay tuned for blog number 2! Or not :D.

<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
